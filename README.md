Notes: <br>


To do (FIX): <br>
No backlog! :D

To do (ADD): <br>
Add Bootstrap CSS for better front end (Low priority) <br>
Add a new user sign up to the login page <br>
Add data validation <br>
Make sure only admins are allowed to CRUD, users are only allowed to read! <br>
Switch to MariaDB (High priority, but easier to test previous steps if on H2) <br>
